Bridge of web2 API data like Square, Shopify, etc. to on-chain.

## Project Description

DAOs are commonly involved with the off-chain world especially IRL, for example, Krause House and LinksDAO, etc.

A particular problem when DAOs operate this way can be the visualization of in real life activities, which does not yet exist on-chain. It is crucial for transparent communication among its community members. To reinforce this, we used Livepeer to broadcast a continuous livestream of our DAO's interior facility in hopes to enhance the community's native experience and organic engagement. For this demo, we used a physical store under the assumption that the DAO runs this retail store but the concept certainly isn't limited to physical stores and could essentially be in any environment such as a conference hall or even a golf club etc.

We believe that on-chain data should be visible in a NFT / token-gated way for exclusive members to access, so we write the off-chain data (web2 - IRL data) aggregated with Chainlink, that includes APIs for smart cameras, credit cares, etc.

Soon after, we have a huge motivation to make this mobile native application so that any community members can interact with its community with a rich experience of their IRL place at the same time of seeing its off-chain activities of DAO.
